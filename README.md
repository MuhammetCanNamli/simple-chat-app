# Project Title

Simple Chat Application

## Description

This project is a simple WebSocket based chat application.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Golang
* Web Browser (Any of them)

### How does it work?

* First, the Go module needs to be installed.
```
go mod init chatapp
go get github.com/gorilla/websocket
```
* Then, the project can be run via terminal/cmd.
```
go build chat_app.go
main
```
or
```
go run chat_app.go
```
* Then we open our index.html file via the web browser. Since the chat can be done with at least two people, it is recommended that you open it in 2 different ways.
* Then we write the message we want to send in the relevant box and click the Send button. A username entry box appears as a pop-up. We enter the name we want in the relevant section and click OK and our message has been sent successfully.
* The other side repeats the same process and we create a conversation.
* When the web page is refreshed, the messages are deleted and the chat starts from the beginning.
